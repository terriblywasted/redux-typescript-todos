1. be able run the project :) (ios simulator) 👌
- Done...

2. fix bugs, ignore resetting data on refresh - it is a feature 👌
- I think I've fixed all of them

3. refactor and optimize the code as much as you can 👌
- Class components to functional
- Use hooks istead of setState
- Updated store to use typed actions
- Use typed redux hooks to create custom selectors and dispatch for todos
- Scrollview to FlatList
- Separate todo View item
- Create styles through RN.StyleSheet.create for better performance 
- Typecheck response JSON in runtime to prevent inconsistent state

4. [Optional] improve project structure for future code updates (new screens etc) 👌
- Idk just sort some files
- I prefer ducks proposal (ducks-modular-redux) with redux but this project is too small to use it
- I've thought about using some async (thunk or saga) library to handle API requests through redux
.. but it's too much for a single request
